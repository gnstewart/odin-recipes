        <h2>How to Make a (Healthy) Enchilada Casserole</h2>
        <p>If you're anything like my wife and me, you love Mexican food, but you don't love the calories.
            We discovered this recipe early on in our relationship, and it's remained a staple ever since, because of its deliciousness and because it's <em>moderately</em> healthy.</p>
            <p>In the end, it doesn't take a lot of work either. You can of course use any other type of meat or add more vegetables for a vegetarian option. We typically use chicken for this recipe, and it is the default we will use in this recipe. While any cooked, shredded chicken will work for this recipe, we typically shred up a rotisserie chicken for its flavor. See more below for the rest of the recommended ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups shredded, cooked chicken</li>
                <li>1 cup cooked rice or quinoa (we use one bag of frozen cauliflower rice)</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups salsa</li>
                <li>1 (4 oz.) can chopped green chiles</li>
                <li>1 can (15 oz.) whole kernel corn</li>
                <li>1 can (15 oz.) blacked beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cheese, divided (I typically use a fiesta blend)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Again, this recipe is fairly versatile, so don't be afraid to add to it or take away to make it perfect for you. Really, go crazy! Add in some jalapenos, onions, or whatever else might sound good to you.</p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Farenheit.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Prep your dish.</strong> Grease your 8x8" (or similar-sized) dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine all ingredients.</strong> Add all ingredients to a mixing bowl, but save half of your allotted cheese until the end. Mix it all together. <img src="stirred.jpeg" alt="All of the ingredients mixed together in a bowl." width="550" height="550"></li>
                <li><strong>Transfer the mixture into the baking dish.</strong> Top with additional cheese and bake for about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Be sure to add any additional toppings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Again, it's so quick and easy. Feel free to serve it over a salad or on a tortilla.</p>
